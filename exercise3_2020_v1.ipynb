    "*Objectives*: Use Spark to process and perform basic analysis on non-relational data, including its DataFrame and SQL interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Grading criteria*: The tasks should all be completed, and questions should all be answered with Python code, SQL queries, shell commands, and markdown cells.  The notebook itself should be completely reproducible (using AWS EC2 instance based on the provided AMI) from start to finish; another person should be able to use the code to obtain the same results as yours.  Note that you will receive no more than partial credit if you do not add text/markdown cells explaining your thinking when appropriate.\n",
